""" overland_flow_driver_springcreek.py

This is a sample driver which utilizes the
OverlandFlow class from generate_overland_flow_DEM.py
across a subwatershed in Spring Creek, Colorado.

This driver takes in a DEM of a subwatershed from
Spring Creek, Colorado and routes a storm across it using
the default input file (overland_flow_input.txt).

This has two ways to look at the data: at one point (generating
a hydrograph and looking for temporal changes in water depth, etc...)
and across the grid for spatial patterns.
