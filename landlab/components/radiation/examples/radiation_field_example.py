    Radiation component calculates total incoming shortwave radiation and
    relative radiation factor (ratio of total radiation incident on the surface
    with respect to the total radiation incident on flat surface).
    This example demonstrates a simple use case for radiation_field.py.
    In this example, a random elevation field of 100m X 100m is created
    with a cell area of 1 m^2 each. A raster grid with this elevation field
    is created. Total incident short wave radiation and radiation factor 
    on a given Julian day (at noon) is calculated and plotted.

    RasterModelGrid module creates a raster grid of size defined by its first

    represents the ratio of total short wave radiation incident on a grid cell
    and flat surface. Hence Radiation Factor will be 1.0 if the grid cell has a
    slope of 0.0 . Therefore, two cellular fields are created on the grid 
    (which means that the two arrays of length equivalent to number of cells
    that the grid has are created and stored in conjunction with the grid. 
    Whenever this grid is transferred, these two cellular fields go with them.
