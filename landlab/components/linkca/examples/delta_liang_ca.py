delta_liang_ca.py

Modifies Man Liang's reduced complexity delta evolution model, implementing a
pair-based scheme after Narteau.
Possible issues using a D4 not D8 scheme. We'll see when we run.

def setup_transition_list():

    Creates and returns a list of Transition() objects to represent state
    transitions for a weathering model.
    
    We employ a scheme where sediment *can* move independently of water 
    precipitons, but once it is caught up by a precipiton, it tends to stay
    with it until ejected to a floodplain, dropped by the flow, or the 
    precipiton reaches the sea.
    
    The states and transitions are as follows (note: X-X means "horizontal"
    pair, X/X means "vertical" pair with first item beneath second):
    
    Node states
    -----------
    0 ocean
    1 channel
    2 floodplain
    3 channel with water packet
    4 channel with sediment packet
    5 channel with water and sediment packet
    6 floodplain with sediment packet
    7 abandoned channel
